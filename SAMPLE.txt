10 points

{{global.conspiracy}}
There is a global conspiracy to make this tool obsolete.

>! This is the start of the first section.
>! You only need four dashes, but more were used here to
>! make the file look nicer. Issues following these two lines
>! will appear under a header titled "Recon satellite".
-------------------------------------------------------------
Recon satellite

>! This is a local macro named "solution". It can be
>! referenced in any issue in this section, but can't be
>! used in issues in other sections.
{{solution}}
You'll need to rotate the satellite clockwise to dock.

>! This is another local macro, this time named
>! "alt.solution". It will also be accessible in this section.
{{alt.solution}}
Use the ship's electromagnets to guide the satellite.

>! This is the first issue. It will generate a button titled
>! "Missing". When clicked, that button will subtract 2 points
>! from the computed score and append the text "No solution
>! was provided. ..." with the "solution" macro expanded at
>! the end.
# Missing (-2 pts)
No solution was provided. {{solution}}

>! This issue illustrates how you can use multiple lines.
>! The newline will be replaced with a space and the macro
>! will be expanded.
# Error detected (-2 pts)
The space shuttle would have detected an error using this
approach. {{solution}}

>! You can also give positive scores to make this issue
>! award points instead.
# System overload (2 pts)
You overloaded the enemy space ship's computers. Excellent!

>! There is no "undefined" macro, so the text of this issue
>! will simply be "Hello, {{undefined}}!"
# Undefined (1 point)
Hello, {{undefined}}!

>! Here is another section. Issues defined here will be shown
>! under the "Meteoroid" header.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Force

>! This section has its own "solution" macro.
{{solution}}
In general, any new Force users will have to be evil in order
to balance the Force since so many existing ones are Jedi.

>! This issue will get the balance solution just above instead
>! of the docking solution from the previous section.
# Missing (3 pts)
The Force problem's answer was missing. {{solution}}

>! {{alt.solution}} is a local macro to a different section,
>! so using it here won't work since it's undefined now.
>! The issue here will just say "...problem. {{alt.solution}}"
>! at the end.
# Graphing (-1 point)
While graphing the number of Jedi vs. Sith works, there is a
simpler way to solve this problem. {{alt.solution}}


>! A third section for your reading pleasure
-------------------------------------------------------------
Clippy

>! This issue has no score, so it will have no effect on the
>! computed score in the comment generator.
# Copy
Did you know? You can middle-click a link to open a new tab.

>! This issue's score is missing one of "pt", "pts", "point",
>! or "points" at the end, so its title will be "Paste (-1)"
>! it won't have any effect on the computed score.
# Paste (-1)
Did you know? You can middle-click a tab to close it.

>! Here we use the global macro defined way up at the top of
>! the file.
# Conspiracy
Did you know? {{global.conspiracy}}


>! This concludes the sample file. As mentioned before, you
>! can make a backup and experiment to find out what happens.
>! You can also copy it and use it for a template to write
>! your own comment files.
